## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
Overview
---
In this project, i used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, i used images from folder "images" which i took from web to run against trained network


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

Repository has following folder/files

* images - Folder has new images which would be tested against CNN trained model
* signnames.csv - File has correct labels for a given traffic sign
* environment.yml - File to create conda environment to run network
* Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb is jupyter notebook to run lane lines algorithm for images and videos
* writeup.md - File has details about approach

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Things to install ( Mac OS )

* Install Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)
* conda env create -f environment.yml
* To start working on environment udacity ```source activate udacity```
* Run ```anaconda-navigator``` to use vscode for debugging and jupyter to run Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
